Problem Statement 😖
Urban areas face constant issues such as inefficient waste management, traffic congestion, and unsafe public spaces. At the same time, city residents struggle to report and track these problems efficiently. This results in delayed actions, contributing to environmental degradation and public dissatisfaction.

Shresta-City aims to improve civic engagement by providing a platform for city residents to report and track various civic issues like garbage on roads, traffic hazards, and more, making it easier for local authorities to address these concerns effectively.

Proposed Solution 🤩
Shresta-City offers a user-friendly platform where citizens can report civic issues, track their status, and be part of the solution. It provides real-time updates and utilizes OTP-based authentication to ensure secure access for users.

Glimps ✨
