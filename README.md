## Problem Statement 😖

In today's world, despite advancements in various sectors, food wastage and hunger persist as critical issues affecting communities worldwide. The inefficiencies in food distribution systems lead to a significant portion of edible food being wasted, while millions continue to suffer from hunger. This not only waste precious resources but also worsen environmental degradation through unnecessary production and disposal. Restaurants, events, and even individuals sometimes end up with more food than they can use, and instead of sharing it with those who need it, it just gets thrown away. This waste is not only bad for the environment but also means that people who could benefit from that food miss out.

---

## Proposed Solution 🤩

Anndaata Connect, a platform that facilitates the efficient redistribution of surplus food by connecting the dots between surplus food and those who need it most to ensure that no edible food goes to waste. By using technology to create a platform where restaurants, event organizers, and individuals can easily donate their excess food, we can ensure that it goes to people who would otherwise go hungry. This not only reduces food waste but also helps to alleviate hunger.

- In addition to ML integration, expanding our solution to reach a larger audience involves strategic partnerships with more restaurants, event hosts, and NGOs across Delhi. Collaborations with government agencies, community organizations, and corporate sponsors can also broaden our reach and impact.
- We also plan to continue improving our platform's functionality and user experience based on feedback from our users.
