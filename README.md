## Problem Statement 😖

Urban areas face critical challenges like waste management inefficiency, traffic issues, and unsafe public spaces. At the same time, citizens often struggle to report such problems effectively. This leads to delayed resolutions, further deteriorating the environment and public well-being.

**Shresta-City Insight** aims to solve this by providing a platform for citizens to report civic issues like garbage on roads, traffic hazards, etc., ensuring timely action and reducing environmental impact.

---

## Proposed Solution 🤩

**Shresta-City Insight** allows users to report issues, track resolutions, upload evidence (such as photos), and receive notifications about the progress of their complaints. It leverages **Firebase** for backend services, and **Twilio** for real-time SMS notifications, keeping users informed about their reports.
